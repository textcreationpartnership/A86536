            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SInce the Lord raiſed us up to be a People to bear witneſs to his Name, and bleſſed everlaſting Truth, great hath been the rage
of the old Enemy, called the Devil and Sathan, and of all his Children againſt us, for the Truths ſake, and no deviſe
nor ſtratagem hath been left, but all manner of ways hath the wicked one, through his Inſtruments tried to render us odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in the ſight of Men; and the more our Innocencie and Uprightneſs appears, the more earneſt is he in finding new devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to darken and to corrupt the Underſtandings and Minds of thoſe in whoſe diſobedient hearts he rules; ſo that when no
wreſtling nor perverting of our Words and Teſtimonies will ſerve his turn, nor no real matter of Charge or Guilt can be
found againſt us; then doth he and his Children flee to the old refuge of Lyes, ſaying, Report, and we will report it; ſo framing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
wicked things out of the wicked Treaſury of their own hearts, and caſting the ſame (ſo far as in them lies, upon us) yea, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
framing and inventing ſuch abominations as they themſelves dare not appear to own with their Names, but leave them as Baſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>births
without a Father, only doing this ſervice for their old Maſter the Devil to buſie and to corrupt the Minds of the Sons and Daughters
of Men, and to get money; for which ſervice in due time they ſhall have their reward.</p>
            <p>And although we account not our ſelves engaged to take notice, or to anſwer all ſuch ſcurrilous, wicked, and ungodly Pamphlets, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch Baſtard-births as aforeſaid, yet at this time ſeeing ſuch a large Brood of theſe Viperous Brats brought forth almoſt together, we are
free to give the world a brief account of the malice, falſhood, and wickedneſs of theſe our Adverſaries, whoever they are, that none may
ſay if they were Lyes why did you not tell us, that whoever believe them evil may be wholly upon their own heads.</p>
            <p>I. And firſt of all we take notice of a wicked Pamphlet lately Printed for <hi>W. Savidge</hi> (as if ſaid) with Allowance, called <hi>Sad and terrible
News from</hi> Newberry, or, <hi>Th. Monſtrous eating Quaker,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Concerning which Relation we have made enquiry; and whereas it is ſaid that he was born and lived at the <hi>Devizes,</hi> that is one Lye; for
we find that he was born and lived at <hi>Weſtbury,</hi> as appears by a Certificate under the hands of the Mayor, Officers, and Inhabitants of the ſaid
Burrough of <hi>Weſtbury,</hi> as followeth:</p>

                        <p>WE of the Inhabitants of the Pariſh and Burrough of <hi>Weſtbury,</hi> whoſe names are hereunto ſubſcribed, do declare and teſtifie unto all people
where ever this may come, or whom it may Concern:</p>
                        <p>That whereas one <hi>Joſeph Bourn,</hi> late of our Pariſh of <hi>Weſtbury</hi> aforeſaid, where he was born, and from his Childhood bred (after years of
underſtanding) to the Trade of a Taylor, who now Travels the Country begging, and is become ſuch a great Eater, not leſs then a Wonder to moſt
ſorts of people where-ever he comes.</p>
                        <p>Now foraſmuch as we underſtand that he is in ſome Countries by ſome taken to be a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and that he had formerly had ſome estate, and that
by leaving his buſineſs and going amongſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> is now impaired, We do a Teſtimony ſigned by us, ſignifie unto all, that he the ſaid <hi>Joſeph
Bourn</hi> was never any <hi>Quaker,</hi> nor otherwiſe a Profeſsor of any Religion, neither was he that ever we heard of at any <hi>Quakers</hi> Meeting, nor held
their Tenents, nor had he ever any estate of his own, as we perceive by ſome has been ſuppoſed; but being from his Youth an idle Boy, has ſo lived
till this came on him; the truth of which is very well known to us his Neighbours and Relations, who have hereunto ſubſcribed the 28th day of <hi>April</hi>
1675.</p>

            <p>Another fruit of this corrupt Tree we find under the name of the <hi>Quaker</hi> turned <hi>Jew</hi> telling a deviſed Story of one <hi>Thomas</hi> a <hi>Quaker</hi> of
